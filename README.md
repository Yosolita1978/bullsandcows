# Bulls and Cows Game

This is a simple implementation of the Bulls and Cows game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Game Description

Bulls and Cows is a code-breaking game where one player thinks of a secret number, and the other player tries to guess it. For each guess, feedback is provided in terms of "bulls" (correct digits in the correct position) and "cows" (correct digits in the wrong position). The game continues until the second player guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts.

## Features

- Randomly generates a 4-digit secret number
- Allows the user to input guesses
- Provides feedback on the number of bulls and cows for each guess
- Limits the user to 10 attempts
- Displays a win or lose message based on the user's performance
